If the Hopf algebra is the group algebra of a group $G$, the\ninvariant counts homomorphisms from the fundamental group of the manifold to\n$G$. The invariant can be viewed as a state model on a Heegaard diagram or a\ntriangulation of the manifold. The computation of the invariant involves tensor\nproducts and contractions of the structure tensors of the algebra. We show that\nevery formal expression involving these tensors corresponds to a unique\n3-manifold modulo a well-understood equivalence. This raises the possibility of\nan algorithm which can determine whether two given 3-manifolds are\nhomeomorphic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 May 1990 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

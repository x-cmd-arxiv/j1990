We show that, if $X$\nis a {\\it \\$}$_\\infty$-space, then a bounded linear operator $T: X\\hat\n\\otimes_\\epsilon Y\\longrightarrow Z$ is 1-summing if and only if a naturally\nassociated operator $T^#: X\\longrightarrow \\prod_1(Y,Z)$ is 1-summing. This\nresult need not be true if $X$ is not a {\\it \\$}$_\\infty$-space. For $p>1$,\nseveral examples are given with $X=C[0,1]$ to show that $T^#$ can be\n$p$-summing without $T$ being $p$-summing. Indeed, there is an operator $T$ on\n$C[0,1]\\hat \\otimes_\\epsilon \\ell_1$ whose associated operator $T^#$ is\n2-summing, but for all $N\\in \\N$, there exists an $N$-dimensional subspace $U$\nof $C[0,1]\\hat \\otimes_\\epsilon \\ell_1$ such that $T$ restricted to $U$ is\nequivalent to the identity operator on $\\ell^N_\\infty$. Finally, we show that\nthere is a compact Hausdorff space $K$ and a bounded linear operator $T:\\\nC(K)\\hat \\otimes_\\epsilon \\ell_1\\longrightarrow \\ell_2$ for which $T^#:\\\nC(K)\\longrightarrow \\prod_1(\\ell_1, \\ell_2)$ is not 2-summing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 1990 20:22:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Dec 1999 05:08:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

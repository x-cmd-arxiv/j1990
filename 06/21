Thus many properties of Banach spaces, including having\nnon-trivial cotype, having the Radon-Nikodym property, and having the analytic\nunconditional martingale difference sequence property, do not pass to\nintermediate spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 1990 18:31:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Dec 1999 04:45:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

We give a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for permutations to induce an isomorphism on\ndyadic BMO. Extensions of this characterization to Lipschitz spaces $\\lip,\n(0<p\\leq1)$ are obtained. When specialized to permutations which act on one\nlevel of the Haar system only, our approach leads to a short straightforward\nproof of a result due to E.M.Semyonov and B.Stoeckert.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 1990 15:32:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

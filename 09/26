It is known that the\nsingularities of free energy of this model lie on the Julia set of some\nrational endomorphism $f$ related to the action of the Migdal-Kadanoff\nrenorm-group. We study the asymptotics of free energy when temperature goes\nalong hyperbolic geodesics to the boundary of an attractive basin of $f$. We\nprove that for almost all (with respect to the harmonic measure) geodesics the\ncomplex critical exponent is common, and compute it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 1990 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

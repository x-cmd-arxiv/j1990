Using property~($\\scriptstyle\\tau$), we give a short proof\nfor a recent deviation inequality due to Talagrand. In a third section, we also\nrecover known concentration results for Gaussian measures using our approach.}\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 1990 15:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

If M is\nan L-structure then P(M) is the L-structure formed as the substructure of M\nwith domain {a: M models P(a)}. Now suppose T is a complete first order theory\nin L with infinite models. Following Hodges, we say that T is relatively\nlambda-categorical if whenever M, N models T, P(M)=P(N), |P(M)|= lambda then\nthere is an isomorphism i:M-> N which is the identity on P(M). T is relatively\ncategorical if it is relatively lambda-categorical for every lambda. The\nquestion arises whether the relative lambda-categoricity of T for some lambda\n>|T| implies that T is relatively categorical.\n  In this paper, we provide an example, for every k>0, of a theory T_k and an\nL_{omega_1 omega} sentence varphi_k so that T_k is relatively\naleph_n-categorical for n < k and varphi_k is aleph_n-categorical for n<k but\nT_k is not relatively beth_k-categorical and varphi_k is not\nbeth_k-categorical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 1990 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

The apparatus to assign systems of cardinal invariants to models of a\nfirst order theory (or determine its impossibility) is developed in [Sh:a]. It\nis natural to try to extend this theory to classes of models which are\ndescribed in other ways. Work on the classification theory for nonelementary\nclasses [Sh:88] and for universal classes [Sh:300] led to the conclusion that\nan axiomatic approach provided the best setting for developing a theory of\nwider application. In the first chapter we describe the axioms on which the\nremainder of the article depends and give some examples and context to justify\nthis level of generality. The study of universal classes takes as a primitive\nthe notion of closing a subset under functions to obtain a model. We replace\nthat concept by the notion of a prime model. We begin the detailed discussion\nof this idea in Chapter II. One of the important contributions of\nclassification theory is the recognition that large models can often be\nanalyzed by means of a family of small models indexed by a tree of height at\nmost omega. More precisely, the analyzed model is prime over such a tree.\nChapter III provides sufficient conditions for prime models over such trees to\nexist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 1990 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

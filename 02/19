The intrinsic characterization is that the restriction of the\nsecond adjoint of the operator to the ideal generated by the lattice in its\nbidual does not preserve a copy of $c_0$. This property of an operator was\nintroduced by C. Niculescu [N2] under the name ``strong type B\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 1990 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

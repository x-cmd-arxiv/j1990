We believe this should be\nuseful in proofs involving random selections. As an illustration of possible\napplications we give a simple proof (though not with the right dependence on\n$\\varepsilon$) of the Bourgain, Lindenstrauss, Milman result [BLM] that for\n$1\\le r < s \\le 2$ and $\\varepsilon >0$, every $n$-dimensional subspace of $L_s\n\\ (1+\\varepsilon)$-embeds into $\\ell ^N_r$ with $N = c(r,s,\\varepsilon)n$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 1990 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

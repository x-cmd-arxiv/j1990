In this paper we study when nuclear\noperators on $C(\\Omega, E)$ spaces can be completely characterized in terms of\nproperties of their representing vector measures. We also show that if $F$ is a\nBanach space and if $T:\\ C(\\Omega, E)\\rightarrow F$ is a nuclear operator, then\n$T$ induces a bounded linear operator $T^\\#$ from the space $C(\\Omega)$ of\nscalar valued continuous functions on $\\Omega$ into $\\slN(E,F)$ the space of\nnuclear operators from $E$ to $F$, in this case we show that $E^*$ has the\nRadon-Nikodym property if and only if $T^\\#$ is nuclear whenever $T$ is\nnuclear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 1990 19:45:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

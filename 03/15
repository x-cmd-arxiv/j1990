In this paper we characterize Integral operators (in\nthe sense of Grothendieck) on $C(X,E)$ spaces in term of their representing\nvector measures. This is then used to give some applications to Nuclear\noperators on $C(X,E)$ spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 1990 15:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

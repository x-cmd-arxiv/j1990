They are based on introductory lectures given at Stony\nBrook during the Fall Term of 1989-90. These lectures are intended to introduce\nthe reader to some key ideas in the field, and to form a basis for further\nstudy. The reader is assumed to be familiar with the rudiments of complex\nvariable theory and of two-dimensional differential geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 1990 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

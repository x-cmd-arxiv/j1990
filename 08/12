If the assumptions of the Koebe principle hold, we show\nthat the joint distortion of the composition is bounded. On the other hand, if\nall maps with possibly non-negative Schwarzian derivative are almost\nlinear-fractional and their nonlinearities tend to cancel leaving only a small\ntotal, then they can all be replaced with affine maps with the same domains and\nimages and the resulting composition is a very good approximation of the\noriginal one. These technical tools are then applied to prove a theorem about\ncritical circle maps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Aug 1990 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
